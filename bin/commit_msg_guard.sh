# commit_msg_guard.sh — enforce the commit-message SUBSTANCE law
# (taught by the agent-team prompt templates + the turn-step brief —
# Owner 2026-10-27 #hq: "This rule doesn't belong to AGENTS.md, but your
# AGENT-TEAM prompt templates"; this guard is enforcement, not the source):
# subjects must describe what changed; mechanical turn metadata is banned.
#
# Owner order 2026-10-27 (#hq): commit messages are written by agents
# about what changed in the code — never "ci turn", "stall", etc.
# Owner order 2026-10-29 (#hq): changes made by agents on CI MUST be
# committed by that agent's author, not the model that ran CI — a
# `turn(<seat>):` commit authored by the CI bot identity is a violation.
#
# Usage: commit_msg_guard.sh <git-range>
#   e.g. commit_msg_guard.sh origin/ai/main..HEAD
#
# Exit 0 = every commit in the range passes.
# Exit 1 = violations printed (sha + subject + reason).
# Exit 2 = the range itself could not be read (never pass silently).
#
# Rules:
#   1. Subject carries >= 3 words.
#   2. Subject does not START with turn-metadata labels:
#      ci-turn / ci-chain / ci turn / ci chain / wip / progress /
#      misc / various / done / temp / tmp / changes / commit / stall=N.
#      (`turn(<seat>):` is the harness's RESERVED host-commit prefix —
#      governed by rule 3, not banned outright.)
#   3. A `turn(<seat>):` subject (host-committed agent work) must carry
#      the AGENT as git author in the AGENTS.md model format
#      MODEL <MODEL@PROVIDER> — never agent-team-ci@users.noreply,
#      never a raw lane string ("model@provider") as the NAME,
#      never "unknown" (Owner correction 2026-10-30 #hq).
